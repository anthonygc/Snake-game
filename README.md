# Snake-game

### Simple yet Nostalgic

I created a snake game with a simple minimalist aesthetic with the guide of a [tutorial](https://www.edureka.co/blog/snake-game-with-pygame/). If you are interested yourself, you can follow this tutorial and make your own arcade style snake game!

The rules are quite simple!

**1.** Stay within the boundries of the screen. If you go off screen, the game ends!

**2.** Collect the red dots that appear within the game. While doing so, your snake will grow.

**3.** Do not crash into yourself or the game will end!

### How to run the game?

- Make sure that you have pygame installed onto your computer. This is a python library with the required dependencies in order to run the application. You can install this library by typing `python3 -m pip install -U pygame --user` if you are on mac or `py -m pip install -U pygame --user` if you are on windows.

- After the installation is complete, you can run the program by navigating to the specific directory where you have cloned this repository. You should then type `python3 snake-game.py`.

- Enjoy!
